# Tripify


(Frontend hosted using Netlify and Heroku used for backend)

I have successfully completed this project using the MERN stack. Tripify is a comprehensive Travel and Tourism website that offers convenient features such as Vehicle Reservations, Hotel Reservations, Tour Packages, Restaurants, Train Bookings, and Event Bookings, all consolidated in one platform. To style our website, I employed Tailwind CSS. We diligently adhered to the Agile methodology throughout the project, ensuring efficient development. Furthermore, I leveraged GitHub for seamless system integration."
